**LLM**

**Description:**
This script demonstrates fine-tuning a question answering model using the SQuAD dataset and evaluating its performance in different inference modes including Floating Point 32 (FP32), BFloat16 (BF16), and TorchScript. The script is designed to provide insights into the performance benefits of using Intel Extension for PyTorch (IPEX) in optimizing the model for inference.

**Setup Instructions:**
1. Install required packages 
2. Ensure Intel Extension for PyTorch (IPEX) is correctly installed and configured in your environment.
3. Set up the SQuAD dataset by importing it from `datasets`.
4. Load the pre-trained model and tokenizer using `AutoModelForQuestionAnswering` and `AutoTokenizer` from Hugging Face Transformers library.
5. Define a preprocessing function to tokenize the input data and prepare it for training and evaluation.
6. Set up training arguments including output directory, learning rate, batch size, number of epochs, etc.
7. Initialize the Trainer object with the model, training arguments, datasets, tokenizer, and data collator.
8. Fine-tune the model using `trainer.train()` method.
9. Evaluate the model's performance in FP32, BF16, and TorchScript inference modes.
10. Summarize and display the results using matplotlib.

**Usage:**
1. Ensure all required dependencies are installed.
2. Run the script in a Python environment with access to the necessary resources.
3. Wait for the training and evaluation processes to complete.
4. Review the output which includes inference times and speedup comparisons.
5. Visualize the results using the generated bar charts.


**Additional Notes:**
- Ensure that your environment is properly set up with the required hardware and software dependencies.
- Make sure to adjust the script parameters such as learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs according to your specific requirements and resources.
- For any issues or inquiries, please refer to the official documentation of the libraries used or consult relevant resources.
